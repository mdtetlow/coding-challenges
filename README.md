# Coding Challenges

The idea is to set a number of coding challenges that make a student (school student) think about how to solve problems using code.

Language choose is a personal thing. At this level (starting out) the question is not "which language is best for the problem domain but rather what language do I want to practice.

For example, if you're learning Scratch at school and that's the extent of you programming expose, then try and solve the challenge in Scratch!

## Programming Languages

There are many langues and many more tutorials available online. W3Schools is a good starting point if you want to try out a language.
